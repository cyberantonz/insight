"""A billing month becomes durable at the sync that reads it, and stays.

The vendor reports spend as period-to-date with no month of its own, and the
connector's `unique_key` carries no month either. Bronze is
`ReplacingMergeTree(_airbyte_extracted_at) ORDER BY unique_key`, so it holds one
row per seat — whatever was read last. The month enters the key in staging, which
is where monthly history accumulates.

The YAML rig seeds bronze once and cannot express that: two months seeded at once
would model a state production never reaches, and would prove nothing about
accumulation. This drives the pipeline twice instead, replacing bronze between
runs the way a sync does.
