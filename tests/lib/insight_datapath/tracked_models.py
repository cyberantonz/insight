"""Materialize dbt models for one test and register what they wrote.

Every suite that seeds bronze and then builds the models above it needs the same
pairing: record the relations the build is about to write into the per-test
truncate ledger, then invoke dbt. Skipping the recording half leaves a test's
staging and silver rows in place for the next test, and the incremental models
read them instead of the seed — so the pairing lives here rather than at each
call site.
