# Architecture

## Bronze / Silver / Gold Layers

**Bronze** — raw tables per source. One row per API object. Use source-native schema and IDs. Naming: `{source}_{entity}`.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:10–18`

**Silver step 1** — `class_{domain}` tables, unified schema, source-native user IDs still present. Produced by the cross-source unification job.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:20–27`

**Silver step 2** — same `class_{domain}` table names, same unified schema, but `person_id` replaces source-native user IDs. Produced by a separate identity resolution job.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:28–33`

**Gold** — derived metrics, no raw events. Use domain-specific names without layer prefix — e.g. `status_periods`, `throughput`, `wip_snapshots`.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:35–40`

## Identity Resolution

The Identity Manager is a PostgreSQL/MariaDB service that maps source-native user identifiers to a canonical `person_id`.

Sources for identity: email, username, employee_id, git login, and similar fields collected by HR connectors.

HR connectors (BambooHR, LDAP/AD) feed the Identity Manager directly alongside their Bronze tables.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:22–26` — Identity Manager diagram.

## Source Categories

Seven source categories currently defined:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| Version Control | GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab |
| Task Tracking | Jira |
| Communication | Microsoft 365, Zulip |
| AI Dev Tool | Cursor |
| AI Tool | Claude Team, ChatGPT Team |
| HR | BambooHR, LDAP/AD |
| CRM | HubSpot |
| Quality / Testing | Allure TestOps |

Evidence: section headings throughout `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md`.

## Collection Run Tables

Every source has exactly one `{source}_collection_runs` table as its final Bronze table. This is a monitoring table only — never an analytics source.

Fields: `run_id`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `status` (`running`/`completed`/`failed`), counts per entity type, `api_calls`, `errors`, `settings`.

Evidence: `docs/CONNECTORS_REFERENCE.md:333–347` — `github_collection_runs`.

## dbt Pipeline Conventions (summary)

**Hard rules** every dbt model under `src/ingestion/silver/` and `src/ingestion/connectors/*/dbt/` MUST follow:

1. **`engine='ReplacingMergeTree(_version)'`** for incremental models. Versionless `ReplacingMergeTree` only for `materialized='table'` with no `_version` column upstream. **Never** plain MergeTree.
2. **`order_by=['unique_key']`** — single column, never composite. Encode the natural key into `unique_key` in staging if needed.
3. **`unique_key` formula** — `{insight_tenant_id}-{insight_source_id}-{natural_key_parts}` everywhere (Airbyte AddFields, Python CDK helpers, SQL concat in explode models, Rust `format!`). Every natural key part MUST be an identifier the source never reissues. A renameable display value (an issue's `owner/repo#7` or `PROJ-12`, a repository path, a login) is an attribute, never a key part: when it changes, the record keeps its `unique_key` and the new value is written under it, so RMT collapses the versions. A key built from such a value would write the record again under the new key, and RMT would collapse neither copy.
4. **Bronze tables are ReplacingMergeTree by construction** — the Airbyte destination creates them as `ReplacingMergeTree(_airbyte_extracted_at) ORDER BY unique_key` (append_dedup, primary key `unique_key`). No promotion step exists; a plain-MergeTree bronze table is a defect.
5. **Connector → silver via `union_by_tag`** — connectors write to per-connector staging models tagged `silver:<class>`; silver class models do `union_by_tag('silver:<class>')`. Never write directly to silver from a connector.
6. **Staging tables not owned by dbt** — wrap on the dbt side as `materialized='ephemeral'` (no DB object; dbt inlines as CTE). None exist today: the Jira field history, once written by a Rust binary, is derived in dbt.
7. **Read pattern** — silver consumers MUST use `SELECT … FROM silver.X FINAL` or `argMax(... ORDER BY _version)`. RMT tables hold multiple versions per `unique_key` until background merge.
8. **Airbyte sync mode** — always `destinationSyncMode='append_dedup'` with `primaryKey=[['unique_key']]`. A stream without a `unique_key` schema property fails catalog normalization (it would land as an ever-duplicating table); `append` and `overwrite` are forbidden. The 2.x destination performs no destination-side dedup work — append_dedup is the same append-only insert path with an engine-level-dedup table shape, so the old OOM concern does not apply.

### Anti-patterns

- ❌ Plain `MergeTree` (default engine) — duplicates accumulate forever
- ❌ Composite `order_by=(...)` instead of `['unique_key']`
- ❌ `materialized='view'` for silver `class_*` / `fct_*` / `mtr_*`
- ❌ `incremental_strategy='delete+insert'` with RMT — two dedup mechanisms stacked
- ❌ Reading silver without `FINAL` / `argMax`
- ❌ Connector emitting record without `unique_key` field

### Reference: shared macros

| Macro | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `union_by_tag(tag)` | Generates `UNION ALL` over all dbt models tagged with `tag`. Patched to handle ephemeral models (no DB relation check). |
| `snapshot()` | Append-only SCD2 helper. |
| `fields_history()` | Per-(entity, field) change log derived from a snapshot. |
| `identity_inputs_from_history()` | Emits UPSERT/DELETE observation rows for `identity.identity_inputs`. |

### Validation

- Skill `/check-dbt-conventions` — LLM-based correctness check (engine, order_by, unique_key formula presence)
- `dbt parse` — Jinja / config syntax (CI gate)
