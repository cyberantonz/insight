"""API endpoint coverage report — which analytics routes the e2e suite exercises.

Two halves:

  1. RECORDING (imported by the rig). `record_response` is an httpx response
     event-hook attached in `AnalyticsProcess.client()` — the single point
     every suite request flows through (metric tests via `call_request`, smoke
     tests directly). It records `(method, path) -> {status codes}` into a
     module-level ledger. `conftest.pytest_sessionfinish` calls `dump_observed`
     to write it to `.artifacts/observed_endpoints.json`.

  2. GATE (run as a plain file, stdlib only — blocking in `./e2e.sh gates`
     and the api-endpoint-coverage-gate CI job). `main` loads that ledger plus
     the committed OpenAPI spec (the universe — kept accurate by the analytics
     OpenAPI drift gate) and reports, per documented operation, which declared
     status codes the suite actually validated.

     BLOCKING is at the OPERATION level: the gate FAILS only when a documented
     operation is exercised by NO test — a new endpoint added to the spec
     without a matching contract test — or when a SKIP_LIST entry rots (now
     exercised, or gone from the spec). It does NOT fail on individual unobserved
     status codes; a covered endpoint that only exercised some of its codes still
     passes.

     PER-STATUS-CODE coverage is REPORTED, not enforced: for each operation the
     report marks every declared code `✓` observed / `✗` declared-but-unobserved
     / `·` excluded, and prints an overall coverage percentage. The percentage's
     denominator is the "coverable" codes — declared minus the ones a black-box
     rig cannot deterministically produce:
       • server-fault 5xx (500) — not deterministically inducible;
       • UNIVERSAL_BOILERPLATE (401/429) — declared on every route by the
         `.standard_errors` boilerplate but never emitted (auth disabled, no
         rate limiter); and
       • BLOCKED[op] — a per-op set the handler cannot answer: SPEC BOILERPLATE
         (the committed spec over-declares 403/404/409/400 on routes that cannot
         answer them — a spec bug, #1669) OR RIG/PRODUCT (persons no Identity
         backend; #1663/#1664). These render `·` and never count against the %.
     Excluded-set hygiene (a `·` code now observed, or a BLOCKED op gone from the
     spec) is surfaced as a NON-blocking advisory, so the suppression list stays
     honest without failing CI when a bug/backend is fixed.

# {400,401,403,404,409,429,500} on EVERY route regardless of what its handler
# can actually produce. So the committed spec over-declares — and until the Rust
# registrations are corrected to per-route declarations (a product change owned
# by the backend devs, intentionally NOT in this test-only PR), the gate has to
# subtract the boilerplate codes each route cannot answer, or it would require
# statuses the API never returns.
#
# `UNIVERSAL_BOILERPLATE` — declared on every route by the boilerplate but the

#     cannot answer them (403 only on admin writes via lock/cross-tenant; 409
#     only on admin-create; 404 only on {id}/lookup routes; 400 only where input
#     is validated). Symptom of the SPEC BUG above (#1669).
#   • RIG/PRODUCT (real, tracked) — #1663: legacy-threshold success codes 500 on
#     read-back; #1664: admin duplicate-create 500s instead of 409. (persons
#     200/404 used to sit here — no Identity backend — now covered via the rig's
#     in-process Identity stub, #1691.)
