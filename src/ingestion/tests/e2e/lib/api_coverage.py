"""API endpoint coverage report — which analytics routes the e2e suite exercises.

Two halves:

  1. RECORDING (imported by the rig). `record_response` is an httpx response
     event-hook attached in `AnalyticsProcess.client()` — the single point
     every suite request flows through (metric tests via `call_request`, smoke
     tests directly). It records `(method, path) -> {status codes}` into a
     module-level ledger. `conftest.pytest_sessionfinish` calls `dump_observed`
     to write it to `.artifacts/observed_endpoints.json`.

  2. GATE (run as a plain file, stdlib only — blocking in `./e2e.sh gates`
     and the api-endpoint-coverage-gate CI job). `main` loads that ledger plus
     the committed OpenAPI spec (the universe — kept accurate by the analytics
     OpenAPI drift gate: the `openapi_spec_matches_committed` golden test +
     openapi-specs.yml) and reports, per documented operation, whether the
     suite exercised it and which declared status codes were validated.
     Verdict per operation is binary like the metric gate: exercised AND seen
     answering an expected status (a declared 2xx, or the EXPECTED_STATUS
     override) -> PASS, SKIP_LIST -> baseline PASS, otherwise -> FAIL; a
     skip/override that is now exercised or no longer in the spec -> FAIL
     (actualize). Coverage is total today (the api/ contract tests exercise
     every operation), so SKIP_LIST is empty — a new spec operation without a
     test fails this gate.
