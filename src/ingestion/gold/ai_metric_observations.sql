-- Source measure observations for the unified metrics runtime. Reads only
-- class-contract fields: activity is row existence (the class contract
-- guarantees rows exist only for real activity — see silver/ai/schema.yml),
-- display labels derive from the tool / surface discriminator codes via the
-- shared vocabulary macros (macros/ai_labels.sql — static product
-- vocabulary, never denormalized into silver rows), and conversation
-- semantics come from data presence (conversation_count is NULL for sources
-- without a conversation concept). Discriminator columns are non-null
-- non-empty by the class contract (enforced by silver schema tests); this
-- model consumes them as-is. No vendor mapping is inlined in this model —
-- labels go through the macros only. Every measure is emitted through the
-- shape macros in macros/metric_observation_measures.sql; filter predicates
-- may reference only class-contract dimension values.
