-- Source measure observations for the unified metrics runtime, wiki family.
-- Reads the wiki class contracts only (class_wiki_pages, class_wiki_activity,
-- class_wiki_engagement); every measure is emitted through the shape macros
-- in macros/metric_observation_measures.sql. No dimensions: wiki sources
-- (Confluence, Outline) feed one undifferentiated family.
--
-- Materialized as a sorted table: the pipeline runs once per dbt build —
-- the only time the silver inputs can have changed — and the ordering key
-- mirrors the runtime's filter shape (source_key, measure_key, entity_id,
-- metric_date), so single-measure queries read index-pruned ranges.
--
-- Grain per measure:
--   day-grain sums (creation date, page author):   pages_created (1/page —
--                    the page object's own author/created_at are the
--                    canonical creation facts; a version-derived proxy
--                    undercounts imported pages)
--   day-grain sums (edit date, version author):    edits (logical edit
--                    sessions — autosave bursts collapsed in silver, see
--                    class_wiki_activity), pages_edited (distinct pages
--                    touched that day)
--   day-grain sums (comment date, page author):    comments (engagement
--                    RECEIVED on the person's pages — footer + inline +
--                    replies; the commenter is deliberately not the entity,
--                    see class_wiki_engagement's page-centric design note)
--
-- Attribution: entity_id = lower(author_email); only email-shaped keys pass.
-- Confluence resolves emails through the Jira directory join in staging and
-- yields NULL on tenants without Jira — those rows are excluded as
-- unmatchable rather than carried as dead entities (cohorts and API requests
-- address people by email). Outline resolves from its own user stream.
--
-- Memory shape: every class read keeps FINAL (ReplacingMergeTree dedup) over
-- a pruned column set. class_wiki_activity is already (author, day) grain,
-- so its sums are near-free. The single join in the model attributes
-- page-day comment rollups to the page author: engagement ⋈ pages on
-- (tenant_id, source_id, page_id) — source_id is part of the key so a
-- page_id colliding across two wiki instances of one tenant cannot fan out.
--
-- Peer measurability (who enters a metric's peer pool) is decided HERE, by
-- row emission — the runtime never fabricates zeros. All four measures are
-- engagement-gated: a row exists only where the source recorded authorship,
-- editing, or received comments. Rostered-but-inactive people take no
-- standing rather than dragging peer medians toward zero.
