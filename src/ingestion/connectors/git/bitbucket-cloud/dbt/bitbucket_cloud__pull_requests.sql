-- Bitbucket carries no diff totals on the pull request itself, so the per-file
-- diffstat rows are the only source of line counts and are summed here.
--
-- INVARIANT: the row key is the file path, so a ReplacingMergeTree replaces a
-- file's row and never removes one — a file a rebase dropped out of the diff
-- keeps its row for ever. The parent's update stamp is the only thing saying
-- which rows belong to the diff the request has NOW, so the newest stamp's rows
-- are taken WHOLE. Resolving each file to its own newest row keeps the dropped
-- file instead, because nothing newer exists to displace it. #3362
--
-- A row with no usable stamp sorts to the epoch, so a request whose rows all
-- predate the stamp is summed entire, as it was before this rule. #3362
