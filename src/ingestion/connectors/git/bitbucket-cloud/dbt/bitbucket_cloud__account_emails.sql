-- Every (Bitbucket account, e-mail) pair the connector has seen, one row per
-- pair.
--
-- Commits carry an e-mail and no account; the workspace roster carries an
-- account and no e-mail. Neither side alone lets a commit reach a person, so
-- this model collects the pairs that name both.
--
-- Two sources, weakest last:
--   1. the commit author lookup, which resolves an e-mail Bitbucket could
--      match to an account whether or not the person ever opened a pull
--      request
--   2. the account on a pull-request commit, which Bitbucket names inline on
--      a response the connector already fetches
--
-- Bitbucket has no noreply-address form, so unlike GitHub there is no third,
-- lookup-free source: an account is named by the vendor or not at all.
--
-- Several e-mails per account is normal and every one of them is kept: a
-- person who changes address still owns what they committed under the old one.
