-- Bitbucket reports a pull request's history as activity entries of three
-- kinds — approval, changes_requested, update — and only `update` says what
-- changed: `changes` is a per-field `{"status": {"old": …, "new": …}}` map.
-- This maps that vocabulary onto the class's (field_id, delta_action, value)
-- triple.
--
-- Bitbucket has no issue tracker in this connector's scope, so every row is a
-- pull request; `item_type` is constant rather than derived.
--
-- An approval carries no field of its own — the approver IS the value — so it
-- becomes a reviewer add, mirroring how the GitHub model treats a review
-- request. Only `update` events with a status change report a previous value.
--
-- FINAL: an activity entry is immutable, but the names projected onto it are
-- not — a window re-fetch after a display-name change re-emits the same key
-- with different values.
