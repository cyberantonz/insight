-- Per-source status dimension; unioned into `silver.class_task_statuses` via
-- `union_by_tag`. GitHub states no lifecycle category anywhere, so which
-- category a value means is an operator's decision, not the vendor's — every
-- row here comes from the binding.
--
-- Two independent status families, deliberately not merged. The issue's own
-- lifecycle is open or closed and a closure states a reason: that pair is the
-- status. A Projects V2 board additionally has its own status column, one
-- field per board, which is where an `in_progress` category can come from. An
-- issue can carry both; they are separate fields with separate bindings, and
-- which one wins for a measure is the `precedence` column's job, not this
-- model's.
--
-- INVARIANT: a value observed in history with no binding must NOT default to a
-- category. It is left out, the coverage test names it, and the build fails —
-- the alternative is an issue that silently never closes.
