-- GitHub deployments -> the vendor-neutral deployment class. A deployment
-- record carries NO outcome — that arrives as status events in
-- class_git_deployment_events, and readers fold the latest one in. A
-- deployment with no event yet is pending, and pending must stay visible.
--
-- FINAL: the record is mutable (updated_at moves), so a window re-fetch
-- within one sync can leave a pre-merge duplicate in bronze.
