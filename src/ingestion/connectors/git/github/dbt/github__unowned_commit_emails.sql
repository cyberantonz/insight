-- Commit author e-mails that no GitHub account claims, with the name the
-- commits carry.
--
-- `github__account_emails` collects the e-mails GitHub could match to an
-- account. What is left over is an address the vendor knows nothing about —
-- almost always a work address its owner never verified on GitHub — and gold
-- attributes commits BY e-mail, so those commits reach no person at all.
--
-- Nothing automatic can resolve them: the account they belong to exists only
-- in a human's head. They are published as accounts of their own so an
-- operator can see them and say whose they are (github__identity_inputs), which
-- is the only mechanism that can close the gap.
--
-- Every unclaimed address is emitted, CI and service identities included. What
-- an address means is the operator's decision — `exclude` is one of their verbs
-- — and a filter here would hide the decision instead of making it.
