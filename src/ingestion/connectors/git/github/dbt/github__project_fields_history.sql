-- Field-level change log of a board's field catalogue, derived from the
-- snapshot: one row per changed attribute per version transition, carrying
-- `old_value` and `new_value`.
--
-- This is what answers "when did that column stop being called X" — the
-- question a status value keyed on a name cannot answer on its own, because
-- the catalogue only ever states the present.
--
-- `entity_id` is the board field's node id, which is globally unique across
-- boards, so it needs no board prefix to stay distinct.
