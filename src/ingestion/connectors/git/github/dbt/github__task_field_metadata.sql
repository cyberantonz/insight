-- Per-source field catalogue; unioned into `silver.class_task_field_metadata`
-- via `union_by_tag`. It states what fields exist and how their values behave,
-- never what they mean — meaning is the operator's binding in `config`.
--
-- Two row groups. The properties that live on the issue itself have no vendor
-- catalogue, so they are declared here under the names GitHub's own API uses
-- for them. The organization's native issue fields come from the catalogue
-- stream, which is also the list an operator reads when authoring a binding.
--
-- A third group is board-scoped. Every Projects V2 board carries its own
-- status column, and a status event names the board rather than a field object
-- — so the bindable field is `project_status:<project node id>`, one per
-- board, and `project_key` records which board it is. Organization issue
-- fields stay null there: they are not project-scoped.
