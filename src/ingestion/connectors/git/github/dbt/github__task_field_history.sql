-- Per-(issue x field x event) history; unioned into
-- `silver.class_task_field_history` via `union_by_tag`. Simpler than the Jira
-- derivation because GitHub's change events carry the whole previous value
-- rather than a delta.
--
-- A timeline records changes, so a field set at creation and never touched
-- never appears in it. One rule produces every initial value: the earliest
-- event's previous value if the field has events, the snapshot value if it has
-- none. Nothing is folded and nothing is replayed.
--
-- Materialized as a table, not incrementally: an initial row depends on the
-- whole event set of its issue, so an incremental build has to reprocess whole
-- issues rather than new events. Worth doing, but not before the model is
-- proven — and when it is done, key `delete+insert` on the issue.
--
-- INVARIANT: `field_id` is the vendor's own identifier, never a role. Gold
-- resolves a role through `config.task_field_roles`; putting a role here would
-- bake one deployment's interpretation into the record of what happened.
--
-- One field identifier is composed rather than quoted: a board's status is
-- `project_status:<project node id>`. GitHub names no field on a board status
-- event — it states the board and the two column names — and every board
-- defines its own status field, so the board is the field's identity. It is
-- NOT the issue's `state`: an issue's open/closed lifecycle and a board column
-- are different fields, bound separately, and nothing here merges them.
