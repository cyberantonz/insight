-- SCD2 snapshot of every board's field catalogue — appends a version only when
-- a tracked column actually changes.
--
-- GitHub exposes no history for a board field: no timeline event fires when a
-- field is renamed, an option is renamed, or a select gains a column. Bronze
-- therefore holds only what is true now, and this is the only record that it
-- was ever different. `options_json` is tracked as a whole because an option
-- rename is a change to the set, and the set is what a status mapping is
-- authored against.
