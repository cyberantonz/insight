-- SCD2 snapshot of board cards — appends a version only when the card's
-- tracked state changes.
--
-- Status history comes from the issue timeline and does NOT depend on this
-- model. Every OTHER board field value does: no API exposes their history, and
-- `updatedAt` says when a value was last touched but never what it was before.
-- Successive versions here are the only way to see one change.
--
-- `field_values_json` is tracked whole, so a version appears when any board
-- field on the card moves. Splitting that into one row per (card, field)
-- belongs in the model that first has a consumer for it — pinning the value
-- shape now would fix a contract nothing reads yet.
