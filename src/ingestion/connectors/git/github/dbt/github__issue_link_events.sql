-- Every link between work items that appeared or disappeared, as a delta.
--
-- A link event states only what changed, never the set that resulted, so the
-- links an issue held at a given moment are a fold over these rows. That fold
-- is `github__task_links`; this model only normalises the vendor's twelve
-- event types into one shape.
--
-- Both ends of a link emit their own event at the same instant — a parent
-- records SubIssue*, its child records ParentIssue* — so a link appears twice
-- in this table, once from each side, and each side is true on its own terms.
-- Deduplicating to a single canonical direction would make the parent's
-- history depend on whether the child was collected.
--
-- That is also why both timelines are read. A link made from the pull-request
-- side is an event on the PULL REQUEST, and the two streams carry the same
-- columns for it, so each side arrives keyed on the item it happened to. The
-- fold downstream keys on (item, link type, target), so the two sides become
-- two intervals rather than one duplicated interval.
