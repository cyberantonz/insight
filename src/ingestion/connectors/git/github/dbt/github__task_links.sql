-- One row per link OCCURRENCE, with the interval it held: `valid_from` when it
-- appeared, `valid_to` when it went away, NULL while it is still there. The
-- question this answers is "which links existed between two dates", which is a
-- range predicate and nothing more:
--
--   WHERE valid_from < :to AND (valid_to IS NULL OR valid_to > :from)
--
-- INVARIANT: `valid_from` belongs to the KEY, not to a version. A link removed
-- and re-added later is two occurrences and two rows, and both are current
-- facts about different intervals — unlike a snapshot version, which would be
-- the same fact restated (ADR-0001, ADR-0004).
--
-- `evidence` says how the interval was established, because the two sources
-- differ in precision and a consumer must not average them:
--   `event`       — an add/remove pair from the issue timeline. Exact to the
--                   second, and the vendor's own record of the change.
--   `observation` — the link was seen present in successive snapshots. The
--                   bounds are first-seen and last-seen, so the true edges lie
--                   somewhere between two syncs.
--
-- Which source rules which link type is not a preference. Hierarchy and
-- dependency links emit a matching add/remove pair, so they fold exactly. A
-- pull request closing an issue does not: the timeline may report it as a
-- connection, as a cross-reference that claims it will NOT close the issue, or
-- not at all, while `closedByPullRequestsReferences` states it plainly. So
-- that one kind is observed and the rest are folded, and no link type is ever
-- built from both.
