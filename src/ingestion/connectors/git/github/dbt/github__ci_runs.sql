-- GitHub Actions workflow runs -> the vendor-neutral CI-run class.
--
-- Duration is finished_at - started_at, never created_at: on a re-run
-- created_at stays with the FIRST attempt while run_started_at moves to the
-- last, so mixing them charges the retried run for the wait between attempts.
--
-- The gate (is_gate) is the class's single definition of "a run that counts
-- toward pass rates": commit-triggered AND carrying a decided outcome.
-- action_required is NOT decided — such a run never executed, it stopped at
-- an approval wall with zero duration. cancelled/skipped are undecided too.
-- A metric wanting a different population gets a different class, not a knob
-- here.
--
-- FINAL: a run is mutable while in progress (status/conclusion/updated_at
-- move), so a window re-fetch within one sync can leave a pre-merge duplicate
-- in bronze.
