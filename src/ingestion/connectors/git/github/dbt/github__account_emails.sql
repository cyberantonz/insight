-- Every (GitHub account, e-mail) pair the connector has seen, one row per pair.
--
-- Commits carry an e-mail and no account; the roster carries an account and,
-- only where a member publishes one, an e-mail. Neither side alone lets a
-- commit reach a person, so this model collects the pairs that name both.
--
-- Four independent sources, weakest last:
--   1. the commit author lookup, which resolves an e-mail GitHub could match
--      to an account whether or not the person ever opened a pull request
--   2. the commit's own account on a pull-request commit, as GitHub matched it
--   3. the profile e-mail on the pull-request author
--   4. the noreply address: the modern form encodes the numeric account id
--      directly; the pre-2017 form carries only the login, resolved through
--      the login_to_id map below where that map is unambiguous
--
-- Several e-mails per account is normal and every one of them is kept: a person
-- who changes address still owns what they committed under the old one.
