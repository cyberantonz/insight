-- Per-source user dimension; unioned into `silver.class_task_users` via
-- `union_by_tag`. Gold joins an issue's assignee to a person through this
-- table and an e-mail, so an account with no known address takes its issues
-- out of every measure — the coverage of `github__account_emails` is the
-- ceiling on how much of the tracker reaches a dashboard.
--
-- `user_id` is the numeric account id as text, not the login: a login is
-- renameable and the identity bridge already keys on the id.
--
-- Several e-mails per account is normal; the earliest observation wins so the
-- choice is stable across runs rather than varying with merge order.
