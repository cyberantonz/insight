-- SCD2 snapshot of the link sets an issue holds — appends a version only when
-- one of them changes.
--
-- Bronze keeps the present, so it cannot answer when a link first appeared.
-- For hierarchy and dependency links the timeline answers that exactly and
-- this model is redundant. For a pull request that closes an issue it is the
-- only answer there is: that link has no reliable event, so the interval model
-- bounds it by when it was first and last observed here.
