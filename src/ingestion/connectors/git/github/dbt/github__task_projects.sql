-- Per-source project dimension; unioned into `silver.class_task_projects` via
-- `union_by_tag`. A repository is what an issue belongs to, so a repository is
-- what plays the project's part. Gold reads none of this today; the class
-- exists so the contract is whole and a later consumer has somewhere to look.
