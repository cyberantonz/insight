-- GitLab deployments -> the vendor-neutral deployment class. Bronze keeps one
-- row per (deployment, status); the deployment itself is the newest of them,
-- and the outcome lives in class_git_deployment_events.
--
-- is_production follows the environment tier GitLab assigns, read from the
-- environment listing: the deployment embeds its environment without the
-- tier. GitLab marks no environment as ephemeral — a review app is an
-- ordinary environment that gets stopped — so is_transient is 0 for every row.
