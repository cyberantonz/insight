-- GitLab merge request -> class_git_pull_requests. pr_id and pr_number are
-- both the per-project iid: every child stream is keyed on it. The project
-- roster is an INNER JOIN — a group listing returns merge requests from every
-- project in the group, including forks and excluded paths the roster never
-- admitted, and those must not reach the class.
--
-- Line totals come from the GraphQL diff-stats stream; REST carries only a
-- capped `changes_count` string. The class columns stay NULL until the stats
-- row exists and GitLab has computed it, so "not collected yet" never reads as
-- "changed nothing".
