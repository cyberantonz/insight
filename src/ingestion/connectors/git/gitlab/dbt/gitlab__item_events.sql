-- Merge-request lifecycle events: every state transition (GitLab keeps
-- closed, reopened and merged as resource state events, so a request closed
-- and reopened twice is four events here and one row in pull_requests) and
-- every label change. Neither event reports where it came from; NULL is the
-- honest previous value, not '' claiming it was empty.
