-- Two sources, two facts. The merge request's `reviewers` array is who was
-- ASKED; the system notes are what they DID — GitLab records every approval,
-- its withdrawal and a request for changes as a system note with the actor
-- and the instant, which the approvals endpoint (current approvers, no time)
-- cannot give. A reviewer who never acted stays a `requested` row.
