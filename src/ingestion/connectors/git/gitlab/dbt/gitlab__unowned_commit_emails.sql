-- Commit author e-mails that no GitLab account claims, with the name the
-- commits carry.
--
-- `gitlab__account_emails` collects the e-mails GitLab could match to an
-- account. What is left over is an address the vendor knows nothing about,
-- and gold attributes commits BY e-mail, so those commits reach no person at
-- all. Nothing automatic can resolve them; they are published as accounts of
-- their own so an operator can see them and say whose they are
-- (gitlab__identity_inputs).
--
-- Every unclaimed address is emitted, CI and service identities included.
-- What an address means is the operator's decision.
