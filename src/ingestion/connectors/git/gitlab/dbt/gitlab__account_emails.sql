-- Every (GitLab account, e-mail) pair the connector has seen, one row per pair.
--
-- Commits carry an e-mail and no account; merge requests carry an account and
-- no e-mail. Neither side alone lets a commit or a request reach a person, so
-- this model collects the pairs that name both:
--   1. the commit author lookup — the proxy enumerates each project's authors,
--      and /users?search= names the account whose address matches
--   2. the instance directory (/users), where the token may read it: `email`
--      for an administrator, `public_email` and `commit_email` for anyone
--   3. the group and project rosters, which carry an address on the editions
--      and tokens that expose one
--   4. the private commit address `{id}-{username}@<commit-email host>`, which
--      states the numeric account id itself; the connector stamps that id only
--      when the host is this instance's own
--
-- Several e-mails per account is normal and every one of them is kept: a
-- person who changes address still owns what they committed under the old one.
