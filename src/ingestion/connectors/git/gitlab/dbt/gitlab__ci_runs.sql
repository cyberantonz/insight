-- GitLab pipelines -> the vendor-neutral CI-run class.
--
-- A project has one pipeline definition (.gitlab-ci.yml), so the project path
-- is the pipeline key; GitLab gives the pipeline no name of its own on the
-- versions this query supports. A retry re-runs jobs inside the same
-- pipeline rather than minting an attempt, so every row is attempt 1.
--
-- The gate (is_gate) is the class's single definition of "a run that counts
-- toward pass rates": commit-triggered AND carrying a decided outcome.
-- canceled, skipped and manual (waiting at a manual job) are undecided.
--
-- FINAL: a pipeline is mutable while it runs (status and updated_at move), so
-- a window re-fetch within one sync can leave a pre-merge duplicate in bronze.
