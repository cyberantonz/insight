-- Worklog lifecycle as field-history events (specs/DELETION-AND-VISIBILITY.md):
-- add / set / remove enter silver.class_task_field_history like any other
-- change (field_id='worklog', event_kind='lifecycle'). The event carries the
-- worklog id — the lookup key into class_task_worklogs — not the payload.
-- add/set are dated by the worklog's own updated timestamp; remove by the
-- /worklog/deleted tombstone timestamp (real deletion time) when present,
-- detection time otherwise. Column order must match
-- silver.class_task_field_history exactly: union_by_tag is positional.
