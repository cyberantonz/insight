-- When the connector first read the field catalogue, per source — written once
-- and kept. See `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md`
-- §3.2: it is the line between a field deleted before the connector ever
-- looked and a field whose metadata has not arrived.
--
-- It cannot be recomputed on demand. `bronze_jira.jira_fields` is a
-- ReplacingMergeTree versioned by `_airbyte_extracted_at`, so once its parts
-- merge each field keeps only its LATEST extraction and `min()` over the table
-- drifts towards the most recent sync — an ever-younger set of events would
-- count as "old". A source already recorded here is skipped, so the instant
-- survives every later run; only `--full-refresh` re-derives it, from whatever
-- bronze still shows at that moment.
