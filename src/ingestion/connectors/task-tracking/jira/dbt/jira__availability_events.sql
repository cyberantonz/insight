-- Availability transitions as synthetic field-history events
-- (specs/DELETION-AND-VISIBILITY.md). Deletion, lost access and re-appearance
-- enter silver.class_task_field_history exactly like any other field change
-- (field_id = 'availability', event_kind = 'availability'), so the entire
-- lifecycle of an issue — including how it disappeared — lives in ONE
-- source-agnostic table. How absence is DETECTED is a per-connector detail
-- (here: the census streams); other task trackers emit the same events from
-- whatever deletion signal their API exposes.
--
-- Column order must match silver.class_task_field_history exactly:
-- union_by_tag concatenates the arms positionally.
