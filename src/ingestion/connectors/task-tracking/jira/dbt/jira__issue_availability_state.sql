-- Current availability per ever-seen issue (specs/DELETION-AND-VISIBILITY.md).
-- An issue is absent when its last census observation is older than the
-- census high-water mark minus a one-sync tolerance. Absence is then
-- classified against the project visibility roster of the same generation:
--
--   present     seen in the latest census generation
--   deleted     absent, project live and visible, below the mass threshold
--   unobserved  absent, project live, but >= threshold of the project's known
--               issues vanished at once — a partial sync or permission edge,
--               not a plausible mass deletion; reclassifies on a later run
--   archived    absent, project archived
--   trashed     absent, project in Jira's project trash
--   access_lost absent, project no longer visible to the account at all
--
-- Issues known only from bronze_jira.jira_issue (never censused) enter the
-- universe with an epoch last-seen: absent from the very first census means
-- deleted before the mechanism landed — the intended historical backfill.
