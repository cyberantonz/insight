-- Comment lifecycle as field-history events (specs/DELETION-AND-VISIBILITY.md):
-- add / set / remove enter silver.class_task_field_history like any other
-- change (field_id='comment', event_kind='lifecycle'). The event carries the
-- comment id — the lookup key into class_task_comments — not the payload.
-- add/set are dated by the comment's own updated timestamp (real time);
-- remove by detection (Jira has no comment-deletion timestamp).
-- Column order must match silver.class_task_field_history exactly:
-- union_by_tag concatenates the arms positionally.
