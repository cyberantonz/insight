-- Every field the changelog names that the field catalogue does not contain, so
-- the exclusion is queryable rather than implicit. See
-- `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md` §3.2.
--
-- These fields cannot be classified even in principle: without a catalogue row
-- there is no `schema_type` to read, so no separator, no id side and no
-- cardinality. Their history is therefore not reconstructed — the journal
-- carries one best-effort `unclassified_field` row per (issue, field) with the
-- last value as it arrived.
--
-- A view: it is a small aggregate over staging, and the current state of the
-- changelog is the current state of the answer.
--
-- What to do with a row here depends on `newest_event`, which is why the column
-- exists. Bronze is append-only with dedup per field, so the catalogue never
-- forgets a field it has seen once:
--
--   * events older than the catalogue's own first sync — the field was deleted
--     before the connector ever looked. Legitimately unclassifiable, and
--     nothing can be done;
--   * events newer than that — the field exists (or existed recently) and its
--     metadata has not arrived. That is a collection gap, not a dead field, and
--     `assert_jira_unclassified_fields_are_old` fails on it.
--
-- The first sync comes from `jira__catalogue_first_seen`, not from bronze: the
-- catalogue table forgets its older extractions as its parts merge.
