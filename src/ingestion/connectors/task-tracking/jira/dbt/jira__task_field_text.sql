-- Bodies of long-text fields, addressed by a hash of their content. The journal
-- stores the hash in `value_ids` and a short prefix in `value_displays`; the
-- full body lives here. See
-- `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md` §8.
--
-- WHY a side table rather than the body inline. ClickHouse is column-oriented,
-- so a query that reads `value_displays` for a status field also reads whatever
-- else that column holds. Descriptions run to tens of kilobytes, so keeping them
-- in the journal's array columns would drag them through every read of any
-- field. Content-addressing also collapses repeated bodies — a body that is
-- re-saved unchanged, or shared across events, stores once.
--
-- INVARIANT: `text_id` is a pure function of `content`, so the same body always
-- resolves to the same row and ReplacingMergeTree collapses duplicates without
-- a version race.
--
-- The two sides of the pipeline carry long text in DIFFERENT representations and
-- both are kept, distinguished by `content_form`:
--
--   * `adf_json`      — the issue JSON holds an Atlassian Document Format
--                       document, the authoritative current body;
--   * `rendered_text` — the changelog holds Jira's plain-text rendering of the
--                       body at that point in time. It is not truncated (bodies
--                       well past 32 KiB arrive whole), but it is a rendering:
--                       formatting, links and embedded media are flattened.
--
-- Because the two forms are not comparable, `long_text` is exempt from the
-- round-trip invariant (§14) — that exemption is a consequence of this
-- asymmetry, not an oversight.
