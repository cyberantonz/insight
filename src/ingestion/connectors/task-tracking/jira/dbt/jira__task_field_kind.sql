-- Per-source field classification: one row per (source, field) carrying the
-- `field_kind` that decides how the field's value is normalized and how its
-- changelog deltas are applied. See
-- `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md` §3.
--
-- View: the classification is a pure function of the current field catalogue,
-- so the current state of bronze is the current state of staging. Bronze
-- `jira_fields` is ReplacingMergeTree keyed by `unique_key`, hence FINAL on
-- the read.
--
-- 'staging' + 'jira' tags are required: the pipeline's staging phase selects
-- the `tag:staging,tag:jira` intersection, and the models that consume this one
-- run in that phase.
