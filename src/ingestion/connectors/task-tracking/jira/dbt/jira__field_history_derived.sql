-- The per-(issue x field x event) journal, derived in dbt. The Jira producer of

-- lifecycle arms and by the GitHub arm. See
-- `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md`.
--
-- Six kinds of row, matching the contract the class consumers rely on (§10):
--   1. one creation marker per issue (`field_id = 'created'`, `_seq = 0`);
--   2. one `synthetic_initial` per (issue, field) holding the value at creation;
--   3. one `changelog` row per event, holding the state after that event;
--   4. one `retired_field` row per (issue, field) the issue stopped carrying;
--   5. one `unclassified_field` row per (issue, field) the catalogue lacks;
--   6. one `snapshot_diff` per (issue, field) the issue cleared without an
--      event — the state as OBSERVED, which is not the same claim as an event.
--
-- Only the element-wise kinds accumulate state across events; every other
-- kind's item carries both sides in full, so its rows are computed from the
-- item alone (§2.1). That is why there is no general fold here.

-- cannot classify even in principle (§3.2).
--
-- Bronze is append-only with dedup per field, so the catalogue never forgets a
-- field it has seen once. Absence therefore means the field was deleted before
-- the first field sync — the dominant case — or created since the last one,
-- which is the dangerous one and is what the recency test separates.
--
-- The history is NOT reconstructed: the field's shape is unknowable, so there is
-- no way to read a list, a separator or an id side. One row per (issue, field)
-- carries the last value verbatim, and `event_kind` says it is best-effort so a
-- consumer counting "issues where this was ever set" can tell it from a derived
-- value.

-- Without an event the journal's newest state stays at whatever the field last

-- agree with the issue's — two streams read at different points of one sync.
--
-- Only an ABSENT key qualifies. A key present with an empty value means the

-- state; if the journal disagrees with it, a clearing event is genuinely
-- missing and must surface as a failure instead of being overwritten here.

-- ── the element-wise kinds, whose state accumulates ────────────────────────
-- Elements are carried as one string per element so ids and displays cannot
-- drift apart; they are split back into the parallel arrays at the end.
--
-- The state is derived PER ELEMENT, never by carrying a running list. An
-- element belongs to the state after event k exactly when its own latest
-- operation at or before k was an `add`; with no operation of its own by then,
-- it belongs there exactly when it belonged at creation. Each element's
-- ordered operations therefore become the SPANS of events over which it is
-- present, and the state after event k is every element whose span covers k.
--
-- Why per element and not the set arithmetic this replaced. The closed form
-- `(initial ∪ additions up to k) \ removals up to k` is wrong for an element
-- added, removed and ADDED AGAIN: it stays subtracted forever, because it is
-- in "every removal". Reading the element's LATEST operation is correct for
-- any cycle — which is what a sequential fold bought, without its cost.
--
-- COST (§13): a running list costs O(n^2) in the number of operations on one
-- (issue, field), either by replaying the list per row or by appending to an
-- accumulator — `arrayPushBack` copies the whole accumulator, so appending n
-- states copies n^2/2 of them. A long-lived list field can accumulate enough
-- events on a single issue to exhaust any memory limit that way, and no
-- partitioning of the input helps: one (issue, field) is one sequence and
-- cannot be split. Spans cost the size of the output and nothing beyond it.
--
-- Presence at creation needs no snapshot: an element whose FIRST operation
-- removed it was there, one whose first operation added it was not. The
-- snapshot supplies only the elements no operation ever touched.
