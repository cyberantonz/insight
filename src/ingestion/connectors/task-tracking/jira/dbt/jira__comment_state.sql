-- Current state per comment, deletion included (specs/DELETION-AND-VISIBILITY.md).
-- is_deleted: deleting a comment bumps the issue's `updated`, which re-syncs
-- the issue's FULL comment list — a comment whose last observation predates
-- its issue's last re-fetch was deleted at the source; comments of
-- deleted/trashed issues are marked through the availability state (their
-- list is never re-fetched). Feeds both the class projection
-- (jira__task_comments) and the lifecycle snapshot chain.
