-- One row per (issue, field) with the field's current value, for EVERY field the
-- issue actually carries — not a hand-picked list. Read by
-- `jira__field_history_derived`, so a field that never appears in the changelog
-- still produces a `synthetic_initial` row.
--
-- Fields are classified by `jira__task_field_kind` and read by the
-- `jira_norm_value` macros; see
-- `connectors/task-tracking/jira/specs/FIELD-HISTORY-IN-DBT.md` §3-§4. Nothing
-- here names a field id: the previous shape of this model enumerated ~10 generic
-- fields by hand, which is why every custom field was missing from the modelled
-- current state and — through `reconstruct_initial` — from the history as well.
--
-- MEMORY. This model reads a JSON column that is gigabytes wide, and earlier
-- shapes of it exhausted the server twice (#1425, #1817). Two rules hold it in
-- place:
--   1. dedup resolves to a raw-id per issue FIRST, in an aggregation that
--      carries only that String — never the JSON. Selecting the JSON into an
--      argMax state, or sorting rows that carry it, puts every issue's payload
--      into one buffer.
--   2. the key/value unpivot happens AFTER that join, so it streams over one
--      row per issue instead of one per bronze emission.
-- A single `argMax` over a wide tuple (the previous shape) also works, but only
-- because the tuple is small; it cannot be extended to all fields.
--
-- The two-pass form has a second benefit: every column is read from ONE chosen
-- bronze row. Independent per-column `argMax` calls can each resolve to a
-- different row when `_airbyte_extracted_at` ties, silently mixing two versions
-- of an issue.
