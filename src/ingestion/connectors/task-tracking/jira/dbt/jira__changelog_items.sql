-- Materialized as `table` (not `incremental`) so every dbt run rewrites staging from scratch.
-- Rationale: the final GROUP BY collapses duplicates at the content-identity level, so
-- bronze append duplicates (same changelog re-emitted across Airbyte runs) produce one
-- staging row regardless.

-- Explode `bronze_jira.jira_issue_history.items` JSON array into one row per field change.
-- Read by `jira__field_history_derived`.
--
-- Each history row has `changelog_id` and a JSON array `items` with elements shaped like:
--   { "field": "...", "fieldId": "...", "from": "...", "fromString": "...",
--     "to": "...", "toString": "..." }
--
-- ClickHouse strategy: arrayJoin() on JSONExtractArrayRaw, then JSONExtract* on each element.
-- Bronze dedup is handled by argMax on the natural key (source_id, changelog_id) picking the
-- latest Airbyte emission, then the final GROUP BY below collapses content-identical items
-- within a single changelog.
--
-- MEMORY. The dedup resolves to a raw id FIRST, in an aggregation that carries
-- only that String, and the payload is fetched by joining back. The earlier
-- shape — `SELECT *` ordered by the extraction stamp with `LIMIT 1 BY` — put
-- every row's `items` JSON into the sort buffer, which is the pattern that
-- exhausted the server in #1425 and #1817. It was fixed in the issue snapshot
-- model and left here.
