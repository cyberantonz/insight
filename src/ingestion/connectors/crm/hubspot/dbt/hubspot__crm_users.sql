-- Live (`owners`) and archived (`owners_archived`) are sibling Bronze tables;
-- ReplacingMergeTree on `unique_key` dedups, with `_version = greatest(updatedAt, archivedAt)`
-- so an archive event always outranks the prior live update. The archived
-- sibling is only synced when Airbyte is configured to backfill deleted
-- records — guard the UNION with adapter.get_relation so absent archived
-- tables don't break the build.
--
-- Two HubSpot identifiers to track per owner:
--   * `user_id`    — `owners.id`     — used in `properties_hubspot_owner_id`
--                                       on deals / engagements (record-owner side).
--   * `hs_user_id` — `owners.userId` — used in `hs_created_by_user_id` on
--                                       engagements + deals (who-logged-it side).
-- Both need to resolve to a single canonical rep (`email`), so we expose
-- them as parallel columns; Silver gold-side joins pick whichever applies.
-- Schema derived from the dbt source so a tenant-prefixed
-- `bronze_hubspot_<tenant>` rename doesn't silently drop the archived arm.
