-- Live + archived sibling Bronze tables UNION ALL'd per engagement type;
-- meetings has no archived sibling because HubSpot returns 400 on
-- /crm/v3/objects/meetings?archived=true ("Paging through deleted objects
-- is not yet supported"). `_version = greatest(updatedAt, archivedAt)` so
-- an archive event outranks the prior live update under ReplacingMergeTree.
-- Archived siblings are only synced when Airbyte's HubSpot connector is
-- configured to backfill deleted records — guard each UNION with
-- adapter.get_relation so absent archived tables don't break the build.
-- Schema derived from the dbt source so a tenant-prefixed
-- `bronze_hubspot_<tenant>` rename doesn't silently drop the archived arms.
