-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Active Directory users → class_people
-- Full-refresh source. Maps directory records to the unified person registry.
-- Current-state snapshot: exactly one row per user. `valid_from` records when the

-- history lives in active_directory__users_snapshot /
-- active_directory__users_fields_history, which accumulate across syncs.
-- Sibling of ms_entra__to_class_people — same column contract, LDAP attributes.

-- `LIMIT 1 BY unique_key` has no ORDER BY, so the winner is undefined.
-- FINAL makes "latest sync wins" deterministic. See ADR-0001.
