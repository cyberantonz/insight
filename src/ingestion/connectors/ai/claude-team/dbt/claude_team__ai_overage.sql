-- Bronze → Silver: Claude Team per-seat credit spend vs limit → class_ai_overage
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_team.claude_team_overage_spend — the per-seat
-- spend-state snapshot pulled via the customer-deployed claude-team-proxy
-- from the claude.ai web API (/api/organizations/{org}/overage_spend_limits).
-- One row per seat (account_uuid). Requires the proxy sessionKey to hold
-- `billing:view` / Owner role — otherwise the Bronze stream is empty
-- (HTTP 403 IGNOREd upstream) and this model yields zero rows (sync GREEN).
--
-- This is the FIRST contributor to the class_ai_overage Silver class and
-- therefore DEFINES its 19-column positional contract (consumed by
-- `union_by_tag('silver:class_ai_overage')`). Any future source (OpenAI,
-- etc.) MUST emit these columns in this exact order — vendor-specific
-- fields go into overage_metrics_json, never new columns.
--
-- UNITS — CRITICAL: unlike claude_team__ai_dev_usage.cost_cents (which casts
-- a decimal-as-string dollar amount × 100), `used_credits` and
-- `monthly_credit_limit` here are ALREADY in minor units (cents, USD,
-- decimal_places=2): monthly_credit_limit=10000 ⇒ $100.00, used_credits=699
-- ⇒ $6.99. So credit_limit_cents / used_amount_cents map straight through
-- with NO ×100. Verified live (149 seats, currency='USD').
--
-- GRAIN: the endpoint reports current-billing-period-to-date spend with no
-- explicit period field. We stamp period_month = start-of-month of the
-- snapshot's extraction time and keep the LATEST snapshot per (seat, month),
-- held against a drop on the month's last day (see the CTE below). As months
-- roll over this accrues a monthly history; within the current month it always
-- reflects the freshest snapshot. unique_key carries the month so a new month
-- never overwrites a prior month's closing value.
-- INVARIANT: full_refresh=false is a data-safety guard. This model is the only
-- place a past month's closing spend exists — the endpoint keeps no history and
-- Bronze rows keyed on the seat alone collapse to its latest state — so a
-- rebuild from Bronze deletes those months rather than reproducing them, and
-- reconcile-connectors dispatches `dbt --full-refresh` automatically on a MAJOR
-- descriptor bump. Silver still rebuilds freely: it reads this model, not
-- Bronze. To rebuild deliberately, drop the table — the empty-table guard below
-- then reloads the whole Bronze window.
