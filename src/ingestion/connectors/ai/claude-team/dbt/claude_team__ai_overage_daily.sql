-- Per-seat reading of the month-to-date overage spend, one row per day the
-- endpoint was read. The sibling claude_team__ai_overage keeps the month's
-- closing state and the full seat state with it; this model keeps only what a
-- trajectory needs, so the two are not copies of one another.
--
-- The vendor reports a cumulative figure for the month in progress and no
-- history, so a day's spend is only ever the difference between two readings.
-- Differencing happens in gold, over the class this feeds: it needs the
-- neighbouring rows, and a correction that lowers the cumulative total has to
-- reach the days already emitted.
--
-- INVARIANT: full_refresh=false, for the same reason the monthly sibling
-- carries it. Bronze keys a reading by seat and day only since claude-team
-- 3.2.0; readings taken before that were overwritten within their month and
-- cannot be reproduced, so a rebuild from Bronze would silently shorten the
-- series rather than restore it.
--
-- INVARIANT: the Bronze read below carries no FINAL, and its dedup is scoped to
-- the DAY rather than to Bronze's own key. Both are deliberate. Before 3.2.0 the
-- key held the month, so every reading of a seat in a month is one row to the
-- table and ReplacingMergeTree keeps only the newest — but it collapses on merge,
-- not on insert, so readings that have not merged yet are still there to be read.
-- This model's first build is the one chance to keep them: FINAL would discard
-- exactly those rows, and a day-scoped LIMIT 1 BY keeps one per reading instead
-- of one per month. What survives is whatever ClickHouse has not merged, so this
-- rescues a tail and never a history.
