-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Claude Team per-user per-day CC usage → class_ai_dev_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_team.claude_team_code_metrics — daily aggregate stream
-- pulled via the customer-deployed claude-team-proxy from the claude.ai
-- web API (/api/organizations/{org_id}/claude_code/metrics). One row per
-- (email, metric_date) — metrics already aggregated to daily grain by the API.
--
-- Filters:
--   any activity counter > 0      — the class contract admits a person-day row
--                                   only for real activity
--   email IS NOT NULL / != ''     — rows without email cannot be attributed
--   metric_date IS NOT NULL       — guard against phantom 1970-01-01 rows
--
-- seat_status: `status`, carried rather than filtered on. The vendor restates
--   it on every read of the rolling window, so it describes the seat as of the
--   read, not as of `day` — filtering on it retroactively erases the whole
--   history of a person whose seat is later deactivated.
--
-- session_count / conversation_count: both `total_sessions`. The Team plan
--   reports no separate conversation counter — for Claude Code a session IS
--   the unit of conversation — so the same number feeds the class contract's
--   activity column and its conversations metric-feed column.
--   DQ note: a session counter can read 0 while lines_accepted > 0 —
--   Anthropic excludes headless / `cc -p` invocations from it. Not a model bug.
--
-- lines_added: `total_lines_accepted` — AI-accepted lines. Same semantics as
--   Enterprise `code_lines_added`. Total keystrokes not available → NULL.
--
-- cost_cents: `total_cost` (decimal-as-string, e.g. "1.23") cast to cents.
--   Claude Team is the first per-user-per-day cost source in Silver; all
--   other sources expose cost at org/workspace grain only.
--
-- prs_with_cc_count / prs_total_count: Anthropic GitHub-app attribution.
--   Populated only on tenants with the app connected; zero on orgs without it.
--   ⚠️ prs_total_count may be a period-aggregate (cumulative), not daily —
--   verify against a tenant with a connected GitHub app.

-- Completeness gate (#3172). The per-user endpoint pages an offset window over

-- and the day keeps whatever the last sound read wrote.
