-- Bronze → Silver step 1: Cursor per-user per-day usage → class_ai_dev_usage
--
-- Source: bronze_cursor.cursor_daily_usage — daily aggregate stream from
-- POST /teams/daily-usage-data. One row per (userId, date) when the user was
-- active that day (isActive=true).
--
-- Filter: isActive=true AND email IS NOT NULL AND trim(email)!=''.
--
-- session_count semantics: Cursor does not expose a per-day "session count" —
-- it exposes chat/composer/agent request counters instead. For class_ai_dev_usage
-- we set session_count=1 per active day, which matches the concept of
-- "a day the user used the tool". Alternative counters (chatRequests,
-- agentRequests, totalTabsAccepted) are carried through as dedicated columns.
--
-- Cost: Cursor prices usage per event, so cost_cents comes from
-- cursor__usage_events (the deduplicated per-event surface) aggregated to
-- email × day. See schema.yml for what the amount means and why `chargedCents`
-- is summed alone.
