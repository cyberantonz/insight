"""The invoice stream: claude.ai wrapper, then the Stripe hosted chain per invoice.

One stream, one bronze table, two kinds of record: every invoice emits its own
row carrying its money and how far its chain got, and a chain that completed adds
one row per line beside it. An invoice's ledger therefore survives a broken chain
without a fabricated price, and it sits on exactly one row — so a later run that
enriches the invoice replaces that row rather than adding its money a second time.

The chain is four hops per invoice:

    claude.ai wrapper   -> hosted_invoice_url
    invoice.stripe.com  -> (acct, token)          [parsed, not requested]
    invoicedata.stripe  -> invoice_id + ephemeral key
    api.stripe.com      -> /lines

The ephemeral key authorises the last hop, is short-lived, and is never written
to a record, a state message or a log line — which is why the chain lives inside
one stream instead of a parent/child pair, whose parent records would persist it.

A `hosted_invoice_url` is not durable: Stripe expires it 30 days after the
invoice's due date, and never later than 120 days, after which it stops
resolving. The wrapper re-issues a fresh URL on every list call, which is why
invoices from any month still enrich — so the URL is followed inside the run
that fetched it and is never stored to be followed later.

This module is the I/O shell. What to emit, and what to emit when a hop fails,
lives in `stripe_chain.build_records` so those rules are exercised without a
socket.
