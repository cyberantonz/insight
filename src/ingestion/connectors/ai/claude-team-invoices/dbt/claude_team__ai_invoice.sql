-- Bronze → Silver: Claude Team vendor invoices → class_ai_invoice
--
-- Source: bronze_claude_team_invoices.claude_team_invoice_lines — one row per
-- invoice plus one per invoice line, produced by the CDK connector that walks the
-- claude.ai invoice wrapper and follows the Stripe hosted chain behind it.
--
-- This is the FIRST contributor to class_ai_invoice and therefore DEFINES its
-- positional contract (consumed by union_by_tag('silver:class_ai_invoice')).
-- Vendor-specific extras go into invoice_metrics_json, never new columns.
--
-- GRAIN: one row per (tenant, source, invoice) carrying that invoice's own
-- money, plus one row per (tenant, source, invoice, line). Invoice money is on
-- the invoice's row alone, so summing it needs no dedup and an invoice whose
-- chain later completes replaces its own row instead of adding a second one.
-- Aggregating to category is gold's job — a class that pre-aggregated would make
-- the per-tier seat price unrecoverable.
--
-- UNITS: Stripe amounts are ALREADY minor units (cents), so they map straight
-- through with NO ×100 — same as claude_team__ai_overage, unlike
-- claude_team__ai_dev_usage.
--
-- PERIOD: dated by the window the line CHARGES for, not by the day the invoice
-- was issued — a monthly invoice is raised at the period boundary and would
-- otherwise land in the neighbouring month. Rows carrying no line fall back to
-- the invoice date.
-- STRATEGY: delete+insert, not append. A deliberate departure from the staging
-- convention (check-dbt-conventions prescribes delete+insert for silver and
-- append for staging), because this model carries an invariant the convention
-- does not anticipate: an invoice's row is REWRITTEN as its chain gets further,
-- so a later sync must replace the row an earlier one wrote rather than stand
-- beside it. Appending leaves both versions until a background merge collapses
-- them, which makes the replacement unobservable — the `unique` test reads
-- without FINAL. The models this convention was written for restate a value
-- under a key that never moves, which union_by_tag already resolves by
-- _version; that is not this case. See #2668.
