-- Identity bridge: (tenant_id, data_source, actor_name) -> resolved work
-- email, for git rows that carry an actor name but no email (pull request
-- authors on sources whose APIs hide emails).
--
-- A view, not a table: dominant-email election must be recomputed over the
-- full commit history on every read, so new commits retroactively re-elect
-- the mapping — the same retroactivity argument that keeps file
-- classification out of incremental silver.
--
-- Tagged 'gold' although conceptually silver-layer: the deploy gate builds
-- `dbt run --select tag:gold`, and this view must exist before
-- git_metric_observations compiles. dbt orders it first via ref().
--
-- Tiers, never guessing:
--   (a) commit co-occurrence — commits carry both author_name and
--       author_email; the dominant email per (tenant, name) wins, a tie
--       between distinct emails at the top count resolves to no row.
--   (b) directory identity_inputs — display_name -> email from connector
--       identity sources; ambiguous display names resolve to no row.
-- Rows exist only for resolved names, so consumers LEFT JOIN and drop
-- misses (honest exclusion). `data_source` is carried so a future
-- per-source refinement (connector-owned username inputs) is non-breaking;
-- today's resolution is source-agnostic.
--
-- The sipHash-to-UUID tenant join mirrors the documented convention in
-- identity_inputs_from_history.sql (identity_inputs keys tenants by hashed
-- UUID; git class rows carry the raw tenant string).
