# Validate Connector

Checks that a connector package meets all requirements from the connector spec.

## Step 1: Automated structural validation (MANDATORY)

Before the checklist review, always run the automated validators:

```bash
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate-strict <category>/<name>
./src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/source.sh validate        <category>/<name>
```

- `validate-strict` — runs the Airbyte Builder UI JSON-schema check (no `$ref` resolution). This is the definitive compat test for the Builder UI. Must exit 0.
- `validate` — runs the CDK loader check (resolves `$ref` first). Lenient; must also exit 0.

If either fails, fix the reported per-path errors before proceeding with the checklist. See `src/ingestion/tools/declarative-connector/README.md` §"Debugging strict-validation errors".

Then run the mock-server test suite (L1 of the test ladder):

```bash
# one-time env: cd src/ingestion/tests/connectors && python3.12 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
src/ingestion/tests/connectors/.venv/bin/pytest src/ingestion/connectors/<category>/<name>/tests/
```

Must exit 0. If `tests/` does not exist, this check FAILS: report the connector as non-compliant with the mock-test spec (see `create.md` §5.7) — a missing suite is a validation failure to fix by authoring the suite, not a skippable gap.

## Step 2: Builder-UI compatibility checklist (manifest-only)

If `validate-strict` passed, these are already satisfied automatically — but eyeball them when reviewing a PR to catch intent mistakes:

- [ ] No whole-object `$ref` to `#/definitions/<X>` or `#/streams/<N>`. Only leaf-field `$ref` into `#/definitions/linked/<Component>/<field>` is allowed.
- [ ] Every `AddFields.fields[]` item has `type: AddedFieldDefinition`.
- [ ] `concurrency_level.default_concurrency` is a literal integer **≥ 2** (with 1 worker the concurrent CDK self-deadlocks at ≥ ~10k partitions — futures-limit throttle with no free worker; fingerprint: records counter frozen at exactly 10000, CPU-busy, zero I/O).
- [ ] `page_size` in `OffsetIncrement` / `CursorPagination` is either a literal integer OR a Jinja template like `"{{ config.get('x_page_size', 100) }}"` (both forms are accepted by the CDK and the Builder UI). Wire declared `*_page_size` config keys via the templated form so operator overrides take effect.
- [ ] Schema `$schema` is `http://json-schema.org/schema#` (not draft-07).
- [ ] Schema type arrays are `[type, "null"]`, not `["null", type]`.
- [ ] `check` block is present and placed BEFORE `definitions`.
- [ ] `version`, `type: DeclarativeSource`, `concurrency_level`, `metadata.autoImportSchema` present.
- [ ] Did NOT copy from `task-tracking/jira` (jira uses whole-object `$ref`; it is a known anti-template).

## Step 2b: Runtime-only pitfalls (checked by per-stream `read`, MANDATORY)

`validate-strict` does not catch these — only a live `read` against a real tenant does. Fail the connector review if any of these are present:

- [ ] `DatetimeBasedCursor` with `step` also has matching `cursor_granularity`. Missing `cursor_granularity` → CDK raises `ValueError: If step is defined, cursor_granularity should be as well`.
- [ ] No `format_datetime(...)` call inside an `AddedFieldDefinition.value` used as a cursor source. That Jinja expression may not render, leaving the literal template as the cursor value. Use native `%ms` / `%s` / `%s_as_float` / `%epoch_microseconds` in `cursor_datetime_formats` to parse epoch values directly from the source field.
- [ ] Every `record.get('X', {}).get('Y')` chain is replaced with `(record.get('X') or {}).get('Y')`. The `.get(key, default)` default only applies when the key is **missing**; it does NOT apply when the key is present with `null` value, and `None.get(...)` crashes the whole slice.
- [ ] Source API query syntax has been verified against a real tenant via `source.sh check`. YouTrack, Jira JQL, Salesforce SOQL each have distinct datetime and operator dialects — template substitution can produce syntactically valid but semantically wrong queries that `validate-strict` cannot detect.
- [ ] No `SubstreamPartitionRouter` parent is a heavy stream (e.g. `fields=*all` / multi-MB responses). The CDK auto-caches parent HTTP responses in SQLite; a heavy parent balloons the cache (observed: 226 MB → silent permanent stall, job "running" with 0 records). Parents must request a minimal field set (pattern: dedicated key-enumeration stream like jira's `jira_issue_keys`, or an inline parent like `_scrum_boards`).
- [ ] Every `DatetimeBasedCursor.cursor_field` exists at the **top level** of the emitted record. If the API nests it (Jira `fields.updated`), an `AddFields` hoist is present — otherwise state never advances and every sync silently re-reads the full window (detectable: resume read returns the same count as the first read).

## Step 2c: Per-stream `read` smoke test (MANDATORY)

Run the per-stream `read` loop from `create.md` §5.6 and verify, for every stream:

- [ ] First-read record count > 0 (unless the source truly has no data).
- [ ] Error count = 0 in both first read and resume read (any `ERROR` / `FATAL` in the log is a blocker).
- [ ] Every emitted record contains `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`.
- [ ] For substreams, the parent_key/partition_field uses the parent's stable internal id (e.g. `youtrack_id` from `record['id']`), NOT a nullable human-readable field like `id_readable` from `record.get('idReadable')` — a `null` value silently routes to `.../None/<endpoint>` which 404s and drops the slice.
- [ ] For incremental streams, a **resume read** (second run after capturing the emitted `STATE` message from stdout and writing it to `state.json`) returns a strict subset of the first-read records — usually zero. The skill's smoke-test script in `create.md` §5.6 does this capture + persist + resume automatically. A naive "second consecutive read" without persisting state cannot validate cursor advancement (`source.sh read` writes Airbyte Protocol JSON to stdout but does not update `state.json` itself).

## Step 3: Spec-level checklist

Read connector package files and verify each item:

### Structure
- [ ] `connector.yaml` exists (nocode) or `Dockerfile` + `source_<name>/source.py` exists (CDK)
- [ ] `descriptor.yaml` exists with required fields (name, version, type, schedule, workflow, dbt_select, connection.namespace)
- [ ] `README.md` exists with prerequisites, K8s Secret fields, streams table, and multi-instance example
- [ ] K8s Secret example in `secrets/connectors/<name>.yaml.example` with `insight_source_id` annotation
- [ ] `dbt/` directory with at least one .sql model and schema.yml
- [ ] `tests/` directory with `test_<stream>.py` per descriptor stream, `config.py`, and `fixtures/` (mock-server tests per `feature-connector-mock-tests`; fixtures contain NO real customer data)

### Manifest (nocode)
- [ ] `version: 7.0.4` or compatible
- [ ] `type: DeclarativeSource`
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_tenant_id` as required
- [ ] `spec.connection_specification` has `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields use prefixes (insight_*, azure_*, github_*, etc.)
- [ ] No bare `tenant_id` or `client_id` in config fields
- [ ] AddFields includes `tenant_id` from `config['insight_tenant_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `source_id` from `config['insight_source_id']`
- [ ] AddFields includes `unique_key` with pattern: `{tenant_id}-{source_id}-{natural_key}`
- [ ] InlineSchemaLoader has `additionalProperties: true`
- [ ] Every `AddFields` target is declared `string` (+ `"null"`) in the inline schema — Jinja emits strings; a target declared `object` gets NULLED by the destination (`DESTINATION_SERIALIZATION_ERROR` in `_airbyte_meta`) on every sync.
- [ ] No `AddFields` re-projects a field the payload already carries (snake_case aliases of `emailAddress`, `displayName`, ...). Injected fields are limited to extraction-time values: config, `unique_key`, `stream_partition.*`, cursor hoists. Renames live in dbt.
- [ ] Schema includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key` as string fields
- [ ] Nullable types used only where API actually returns null (not all fields)
- [ ] EVERY top-level stream — including lightweight substream parents added for cache hygiene — carries the full identity stamp (`tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`). Reconcile (ADR-0015) auto-selects every discovered stream, so "helper" top-level streams land as real bronze tables; the destination keys them on `unique_key` (append_dedup), so a stream without the stamp accumulates unbounded duplicates. Parent streams that must NOT become tables go inline inside `partition_router.parent_stream_configs[].stream` instead (invisible to discover).

### CDK (Python)
- [ ] `parse_response()` injects `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] `unique_key` includes `tenant_id` and `source_id`
- [ ] `spec.json` has `insight_tenant_id` and `insight_source_id` as required
- [ ] All config fields in `spec.json` use source-specific prefixes (`insight_*`, `github_*`, `jira_*`, etc.)
- [ ] No bare field names (`token`, `client_id`, `tenant_id`, `start_date`, etc.) in `connectionSpecification.properties`

### Descriptor
- [ ] `name` matches directory name
- [ ] `version` is bumped in the SAME PR as any `connector.yaml` change — reconcile republishes the nocode manifest only on descriptor-version drift (equal versions → noop), so a manifest edit without a bump silently never reaches Airbyte
- [ ] `connection.namespace` = `bronze_<name>`
- [ ] `dbt_select` is `tag:<name>+` where `<name>` is the descriptor `name` verbatim (hyphenated slug), e.g. `tag:zulip-proxy+` — must match the model tags above. (Note: the deployed silver step ignores this and derives `tag:{{data_source}}+` itself, but keep them consistent so manual/staging dbt runs select correctly.)
- [ ] `schedule` is valid cron expression
- [ ] `workflow` field is present
- [ ] No `streams` block (streams are owned by Airbyte connector, discovered via `airbyte discover`)
- [ ] No `silver_targets` block (Silver targets are determined by dbt model tags via `dbt_select`)

### Rule: `connector-images-block` (FATAL — when Dockerfile present)

**Applies to**: every connector directory under `src/ingestion/connectors/**/` that contains at least one `Dockerfile`. Nocode connectors (no Dockerfile) are exempt.

**Severity**: FATAL — failing this rule means the connector image will silently never be rebuilt in CI, OR reconcile will fail to register the connector. Validate exits 2 on failure.

**Check 1 — `descriptor.yaml.images:` is well-formed (map-style per ADR-0016)**

- `descriptor.yaml` MUST contain an `images:` block that is a YAML map (NOT a list).
- The map MUST have at least one key. Keys are free-form identifiers; the reserved keys `cdk` and `enrich` have runtime semantics.
- Each entry MUST have all four fields: `name`, `dockerfile`, `context`, `image`.
- `dockerfile` and `context` paths, joined to the connector directory, MUST resolve to a real file (`dockerfile`) and a real directory (`context`) on disk.
- `image` MUST be a string; empty string `""` is allowed for not-yet-published images. If non-empty, MUST be a full image reference (`registry/repo:tag` or `registry/repo@sha256:...`).

**Check 2 — No top-level legacy fields**

- `descriptor.yaml` MUST NOT contain top-level `cdk_image:` or `enrich_image:` keys. These were SUPERSEDED by ADR-0016. `yq -r '.cdk_image, .enrich_image' <descriptor>` MUST return `null` on both.

**Check 3 — paths-filter exclusion in CI**

- `.github/workflows/build-images.yml` `changes` job's paths-filter MUST contain an entry for the connector's snake_case slug whose includes match the connector dir AND explicitly exclude `descriptor.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  <slug>:
    - 'src/ingestion/connectors/<category>/<name>/**'
    - '!src/ingestion/connectors/<category>/<name>/descriptor.yaml'
  ```

  Without the exclusion, the descriptor-bump commit re-triggers the image build and the workflow loops forever.

**Check 4 — Reserved-key runtime requirements**

- If `images.cdk` is present and `image` is non-empty: reconcile reads it; no further action required.
- If `images.cdk` is present but `image` is empty: reconcile WARN+skips registration (acceptable for not-yet-built connectors).
- If `images.enrich` is present: at least one workflow template under `charts/insight/templates/ingestion/` MUST reference `<connector>_enrich_image` as a parameter (so reconcile's render step can propagate it).

**Check 5 — Strict semver `version:` (CI bump precondition)**

- Because the CI `bump-descriptors` job bumps `descriptor.version` by one minor every time an image rebuilds (per ADR-0016 + ADR-0015), the field MUST be on strict-semver form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` from day one. The matcher is `.github/workflows/scripts/bump-descriptor-version.sh --descriptor <path> --print-only` succeeding (exit 0) — it prints the version it *would* write and leaves the file untouched.
- `bump-descriptors` fires **only on the push to `main`**, so this check failing does NOT fail the PR on its own. Run Check 8 (the wiring guard), which does.
- Applies to descriptors that declare an `images:` block. Descriptors without one never reach `bump-descriptors`; legacy non-semver values there (`ai/openai`, `collaboration/slack`) are tolerated per ADR-0015 §"Legacy non-semver values" — report as a warning, not a failure.
- Each of MAJOR, MINOR, PATCH MUST be `0` or a non-zero digit followed by more digits (no leading zeros — semver.org §2).
- NO `v` prefix, NO pre-release suffix, NO build metadata.
- Examples that PASS: `1.0.0`, `0.1.0`, `10.20.30`, `100.0.0`.
- Examples that FAIL: `2026.05.04` (leading zeros), `1.0` (two segments), `v1.0.0` (prefix), `1.0.0-rc1` (pre-release), `1.0` (any non-three-segment form).

**Output on failure** (one bullet per missing check):

- `Connector <name>: missing descriptor.images: block (must be a map with at least one key) — see ADR-0016.`
- `Connector <name>: top-level cdk_image:/enrich_image: still present — must be removed (ADR-0011/0014 SUPERSEDED).`
- `Connector <name>: images.<key> missing required field (name|dockerfile|context|image).`
- `Connector <name>: images.<key>.dockerfile/<context> does not resolve to an existing file/directory.`
- `Connector <name>: paths-filter for <slug> does not exclude descriptor.yaml; descriptor-bump commit will infinite-loop.`
- `Connector <name>: images.enrich present but no chart workflow template references <connector>_enrich_image parameter.`
- `Connector <name>: descriptor.version is not strict semver MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH — CI bump-descriptors will fail loud on next image rebuild. Got: '<value>'. Fix to e.g. "1.0.0".`

**Check 6 — Registered in `connectors-config.yaml` (bootstrap-db precondition)**

- `src/ingestion/scripts/bootstrap-db/connectors-config.yaml` MUST contain an entry whose `path` equals `<category>/<name>`. Without it `bootstrap-db.sh` never creates `bronze_<snake>`, the connector's dbt models fail `Code: 81 UNKNOWN_DATABASE`, `set -e` aborts the run before the gold-view migrations, and the regenerated `connectors-ddl` snapshot silently loses whatever was downstream.
- Fix: `cd src/ingestion/scripts/bootstrap-db && ./generate-connectors-config.sh '<category>/<name>'`, then merge the fragment by hand. NEVER regenerate the whole file — it replaces the `env:` credential refs with fake `value:` entries.

**Check 7 — Shared silver class column types agree across sources**

- For every `silver:class_<X>`-tagged staging model, each column MUST carry the same type as the sibling sources' models for that class. `union_by_tag` UNION ALLs them; a mismatch raises `Code: 386 NO_COMMON_TYPE` and the shared class table fails to build for ALL sources.
- Highest-risk shape is a `CAST(NULL AS <type>) AS <col>` placeholder. Compare with `grep -rn '<col>' src/ingestion/connectors/*/*/dbt/*__<class>.sql`.

**Check 8 — Wiring guard (the only pre-merge gate of the three above)**

```bash
python3 scripts/ci/connector_wiring.py
```

- MUST exit 0. Covers Check 5 (semver, for image-bearing descriptors), Check 6, Check 7, and the `class_<X>.sql` `depends_on` edge in one pass.
- Warnings are acceptable and do not fail it: an empty `images.*.image` on a brand-new connector is expected (the first `main` build patches it), and legacy non-semver versions on image-less descriptors are tolerated by ADR-0015.
- Runs in CI as the `connector-wiring-guard` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Checks 5–7 otherwise surface only *after* merge, so this is the one that actually blocks a bad PR.

**Output on failure**:

- `Connector <name>: no entry in scripts/bootstrap-db/connectors-config.yaml — bootstrap-db will not create bronze_<snake>; dbt fails Code 81 and takes the shared silver class down.`
- `Connector <name>: class_<X> column '<col>' typed <T1> but sibling <other> uses <T2> — union_by_tag will raise Code 386 NO_COMMON_TYPE.`

### dbt Models
- [ ] Model name follows `<connector>__<domain>.sql` pattern
- [ ] `materialized='incremental'`
- [ ] `schema='staging'`
- [ ] First tag is the connector **slug = descriptor `name` verbatim (hyphenated)**, NOT the snake_case file prefix. The silver pipeline step (`transform-legacy` in `ingestion-pipeline`) hardcodes its selector as `tag:{{data_source}}+` (= `tag:<descriptor name>+`) and ignores `dbt_select`; a snake-cased tag (e.g. `zulip_proxy` instead of `zulip-proxy`) is never selected → dbt logs `Nothing to do` and silver silently never builds. Check: every model's first tag === `yq '.name' descriptor.yaml`. (Slug == snake for hyphen-free connectors, so this only bites `zulip-proxy`/`claude-team`/`ms-entra`-style names.)
- [ ] Plus `silver:class_<domain>` on the silver metric model(s)
- [ ] SELECT includes `tenant_id`, `source_id`, `unique_key`
- [ ] Uses `{{ source('bronze_<name>', '<stream>') }}`
- [ ] Has `{% if is_incremental() %}` block

### Identity Resolution inputs

- [ ] If the connector ingests a user-directory stream with emails (or another
  person-identifying value), the three-macro chain is present:
  `<name>__users_snapshot` (snapshot) → `<name>__users_fields_history`
  (fields_history) → `<name>__identity_inputs` (identity_inputs_from_history,
  tagged `silver:identity_inputs`). See `create.md` §3.6b.
- [ ] `src/ingestion/silver/_shared/identity_inputs.sql` carries a
  `-- depends_on: {{ ref('<name>__identity_inputs') }}` line for the connector.
- [ ] `fields_history(entity_id_col=…)` evaluates to a **String**. If the source
  user id is numeric (ClickHouse `Decimal`/`Int` — typical when the bronze field
  is a JSON number), it MUST be wrapped: `entity_id_col='toString(id)'`. Otherwise
  `<name>__identity_inputs` fails at run time with `Code 386 NO_COMMON_TYPE`
  (`String` vs `Decimal`) on the macro's final `UNION ALL`, because `entity_id`
  is emitted into the String-typed `value` column. `validate-strict` cannot catch
  this — only a `dbt run` (or per-stream build) against real data does.
- [ ] If the source has NO user directory, the README documents the
  alternative resolution path instead (e.g. Confluence → jira_user JOIN).

### dbt schema.yml
- [ ] Source defined with `schema: bronze_<name>`
- [ ] Model has `tenant_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `source_id` with not_null test
- [ ] Model has `unique_key` with not_null and unique tests

### Bronze Table Shape

The Airbyte destination creates every bronze table as `ReplacingMergeTree(_airbyte_extracted_at) ORDER BY unique_key` (append_dedup with primary key `unique_key` — configured by reconcile's `normalize_catalog.py` and mirrored by `bootstrap-db/create-connector-tables.sh`). No promotion step exists (#2877); nothing to add on the dbt side.

- [ ] Every stream's inline schema declares `unique_key` and the `AddFields` formula can never yield null/empty (the destination makes the column NOT NULL)
- [ ] No `promote_bronze_to_rmt` calls or `__bronze_promoted` models are introduced
### Dashboard metric surfacing (only if the connector should appear in the UI)

A connector whose silver class feeds a dashboard metric does NOT surface in the
UI from the silver model alone — the gold view, the metric `query_ref`(s), and
the catalog each enumerate inputs explicitly (see `create.md` §3.6c).
If the connector is expected to show a per-person card, verify the full chain;
if it is bronze-only or its class has no gold consumer, confirm the README says
so and skip this section.

- [ ] Silver class `class_<X>.sql` carries `-- depends_on: {{ ref('<snake>__<class>') }}` for the connector.
- [ ] The gold `insight.<section>_bullet_rows` view has a branch `FROM silver.class_<X> WHERE data_source = 'insight_<snake>'` emitting the connector's `metric_key`(s). (`data_source` literal == what the silver model SELECTs.)
- [ ] EVERY bullet `query_ref` that should show the key was re-set in a NEW append-only SeaORM migration — the key appears in both the `sumIf(... metric_key='<k>') AS <k>_v` list AND the `ARRAY JOIN [('<k>', <k>_v), …]` unpivot. A section typically has several copies (IC `…0012`-style, Team, member-values `…0041`, dept-dist `…0045`); each must be updated for the surface it backs. Base the new SQL on the LATEST migration that set that id (grep the metric hex id), and register the migration in `migration/mod.rs`.
- [ ] A `metric_catalog` row + product-default `metric_threshold` for `<section>_bullet_rows.<metric_key>` exists (new append-only migration, `source_tags: ["<slug>"]`, registered in `mod.rs`).
- [ ] An e2e fixture (`/metric-test`) seeds bronze and asserts the metric_key's value end-to-end; any sibling test asserting the section's `size(items)` was bumped for the new key.

### Credentials Template
- [ ] `credentials.yaml.example` lists all required fields
- [ ] `insight_source_id` is included
- [ ] No real credentials in any tracked file

### Repo-wide wiring (EVERY connector — Checks 6-8)
- [ ] Entry in `src/ingestion/scripts/bootstrap-db/connectors-config.yaml` with `path: <category>/<name>`
- [ ] Shared silver class column types identical to sibling sources (no `Code: 386` risk)
- [ ] `python3 scripts/ci/connector_wiring.py` exits 0
